# How to search only your favorite recipe sites when looking up recipes


Hyperweb can automatically detect when you are searching for recipe related queries. It then allows you to filter the results to just sites that you trust. This is a free feature.

To do this, configure your favorite news sources under `Popular > Custom Recipe Search`. You can use our suggestions or add your own sites.

Now, when we detect that you are searching for recipes, Hyperweb will offer a filter for "My Recipe Search" that allows you to see results just from your trusted sources.

This feature is currently only supported on the following search engines

* Google
* Bing
* DuckDuckGo
* Ecosia

Note that the logic that detects whether a query is about recipes does not work 100% of the time, though we are constantly improving it and appreciate feedback via `feedback@hyperweb.app`. We also welcome suggestions for new sources.
