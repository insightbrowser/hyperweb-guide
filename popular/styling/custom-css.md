Hyperweb allows you to inject custom CSS on any website to change the style as you see fit.

Under the Popular tab go to Custom Styles. From there you can

1. Enable or disable a style suggested by us
2. A a custom style from a URL, e.g. https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-instagram/raw/master/instagram.user.styl

Some galleries for custom CSS include
- https://userstyles.world/
- https://userstyles.org/

Note that Safari loads the mobile version of pages by default, so any styles designed for the desktop version may not work properly.
