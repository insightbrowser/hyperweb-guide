# Hyperweb Guide

Hyperweb is an all-in-one extension for iOS Safari. It saves you the hassle of constantly being on the lookout for useful new extensions. It bundles many in-demand Safari extensions for free, including:

- Ad-blocking, popup dismissal and cookie notice auto-accept
- Dark mode for any website
- Overriding the Safari default search engine
- Custom CSS and Javascript injection

But Hyperweb's full power is in [smart suggested enhancements](/suggested) that automatically show up as you browse relevant sites, and the ability to create [powerful enhancements using an if-then GUI](/local) within the app itself.

We hope you enjoy Hyperweb, and feel free to reach out to us via `support@hyperweb.app` with any questions.
