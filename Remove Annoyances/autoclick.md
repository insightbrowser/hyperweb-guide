# Auto-click Elements

Certain popups with overlay are hard to block using ad-blockers. These include prompts to "download the app" or "subscribe to the newsletter".

The best way to dismiss them is through clicking on a dismiss button. Hyperweb supports auto-clicking elements and can use Easylist format filter lists. This feature is free and available under `Popular > Autoclicker`

Note that Auto-clicking is slower than [content blocking](/remove-annoyances/block-content) because it is executed only after the page is fully loaded. It is also prone to breaking if the publisher changes syntax.
