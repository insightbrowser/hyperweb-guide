# Block Ads and Annoyances

Hyperweb has a powerful built-in blocker that lets you block
- Ads
- Privacy disrespecting trackers
- Annoying popups
- and more...

You can configure the blocker under `Popular > Blocker` using our suggested blocklists or by adding your own from a URL.

The blocker is compatible with the Easylist format and we recommend searching for your own blocklists on [Filterlists.com](https://filterlists.com)
