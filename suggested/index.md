These are all configurable under the "Suggested" tab. You can also long-press any suggested extension to move it to the ["Local"](/local) tab and customize it.

The suggested enhancements fall into the following categories:

* Search Enhancement: Offers alternative search engines when appropriate, disables AMP, etc.
* Shopping: For filtering fake reviews, price tracking, offering alternative places to buy, etc.
* Video: For disabling restrictions and annoyances around video websites
* Reading: For decluttering general reading pages, seeing archives, annotating etc.
