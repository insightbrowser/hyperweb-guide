# Suggested Enhancements

Hyperweb automatically suggests enhancements for a wide variety of sites. Some are enabled by default and some are not, but you can fully configure which ones you'd like to enable.

These are all configurable under the "Suggested" tab. You can also long-press any suggested extension to move it to the ["Local"](/local) tab and customize it.
